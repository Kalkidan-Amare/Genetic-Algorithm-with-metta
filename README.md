# Minimalist Genetic Algorithm in MeTTa

This project is an implementation of a simple Genetic Algorithm, developed as a task for the iCog Labs training program. It is written in a pure, foundational subset of the MeTTa language to solve the classic "Maximize Ones" problem.

The core philosophy of this implementation is robustness and clarity. It intentionally avoids complex or non-standard functions, instead building essential tools like `sort` and `map` from the ground up using basic recursion. This ensures the code is not only educational but also guaranteed to run correctly in minimalist MeTTa environments where advanced features may be absent or buggy.

### The Problem: "Maximize Ones"

The goal is simple: to find a binary string of a fixed length that contains only ones. For an 8-bit individual, the perfect solution—the target of our evolution—is `(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1)`. While trivial for a human, this problem serves as an excellent benchmark for demonstrating the core mechanics of a genetic algorithm.

### The Solution: A Genetic Algorithm

This system solves the problem by simulating natural selection. It starts with a random collection of solutions and iteratively refines them over several generations. The key concepts are:

*   **Population**: A collection of candidate solutions, where each solution is an 8-bit binary string (e.g., `(1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1)`).
*   **Fitness**: A score that measures how "good" a solution is. In this project, the fitness is simply the sum of the bits in the string. A higher score is better.
*   **Selection**: The process of choosing the best individuals to act as parents for the next generation. This project uses an "elitist" selection model, where the two fittest individuals are always chosen.
*   **Crossover**: The method for creating a new "child" solution by combining the genetic material of two parents. This is how successful traits are passed on and combined.

By repeatedly selecting the best parents and creating new offspring through crossover, the overall fitness of the population improves over time, driving it toward the perfect solution.

### How the Code Works: The Algorithm in MeTTa

The entire program is driven by a series of simple, recursive functions that execute the evolutionary cycle.

**Step 1: Initialization**
The process begins by creating an initial population of 10 random 8-bit individuals. The `create-population` function handles this by calling `create-individual` repeatedly, building the population one member at a time.

**Step 2: The Generational Cycle**
The main engine is the `genetic-programming` function. It takes the current population and generation number, performs one cycle of evolution, and then calls itself to start the next generation.

**Step 3: Evaluation and Sorting**
Inside the main loop, the first action is to determine the fitness of every individual in the current population.
1.  The manually implemented `map` function is used to apply a `pair-with-fitness` function to each individual. This transforms the population from a list like `((1 0 1)...)` to an evaluated list like `((3 (1 0 1)...))`.
2.  This evaluated list is then sorted in descending order using our custom `sort` function, placing the fittest individuals at the top.

**Step 4: Selection and Crossover**
With the population sorted, the selection process is simple and deterministic:
1.  The top two individuals in the sorted list are chosen as `parent1` and `parent2`.
2.  The `build-next-generation` function is then called. It repeatedly creates new children by performing crossover on these two elite parents. Crossover is handled by manually implemented `sublist-recursive` and `concatinate` functions, which split the parents at a fixed point and join the parts to form a child.
3.  This process continues until a new population of 10 children has been created. No mutation is used, simplifying the algorithm to its core components.

**Step 5: Termination**
The `genetic-programming` function checks for two conditions to stop the evolution:
1.  If the maximum number of generations has been reached.
2.  If a perfect solution (a fitness score of 8) has been found.

If either condition is met, the recursion stops, and the final, best-evolved individual is presented as the solution.
